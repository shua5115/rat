# Minimal Rational Numbers Library for C and Lua
Implemented as a single-header library for C: `rat.h`
With a Lua wrapper for scripting: `rat_lua.h, rat_lua.c`

- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
- Fraction simplification
- Conversions between floating and rational representations
- Operations avoid integer overflow while keeping maximum precision
